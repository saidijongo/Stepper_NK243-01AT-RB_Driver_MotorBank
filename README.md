# Stepper_NK243-01AT-RB_Driver_MotorBank
In my new project I have to rotate a 2-phases stepper motor NK243-01AT-RB with a motorbank driver. Motor's A+,A-, B+ and B- are connected to the driver motor terminals. Driver's DIRECTION (DIR), STEP (STP) and ENABLE (EN) terminals are connected to arduino nano rp2040 digital pin 5,6 and 7 respectively.
